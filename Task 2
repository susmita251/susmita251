#Calculator Program in python by defining operations

# Define Operators or Functions: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division

# Addition

def addition(n1, n2):
    return n1 + n2

# Subtraction

def subtraction(n1, n2):
    return n1 - n2

# Multiplication

def multiplication(n1, n2):
    return n1 * n2

# Division

def division(n1, n2):
    return n1 / n2


print("Select Operations")
print(
    "1. Addition\n"\
    "2. Subtraction\n"\
    "3. Multiplication\n"\
    "4. Division\n")

# Giving the option to the user to choose the operation

operation = int(input("Enter choice of operation 1/2/3/4: "))


#Taking Input from the Users

n1 = float(input("Enter the First Number: "))
n2 = float(input("Enter the Second Number: "))


# Apply Conditional Statements: To make operation as-per-user choices

if operation == 1:
    print (n1, "+", n2, "=", addition(n1, n2))

elif operation == 2:
    print (n1, "-", n2, "=", subtraction(n1, n2)) 

elif operation == 3:
    print (n1, "*", n2, "=", multiplication(n1, n2)) 
    
elif operation == 4:
    print (n1, "/", n2, "=", division(n1, n2)) 
    
else:
    print("Invalid Input")
